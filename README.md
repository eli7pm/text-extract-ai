## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Add support for multiple document formats
- [ ] Batch processing for multiple PDFs
- [ ] Export to different formats (Markdown, JSON, etc.)
- [ ] Document history and version control
- [ ] User authentication and saved documents
- [ ] API rate limiting and usage analytics

## 💰 Cost Considerations

This project uses:
- **GitHub Pages**: Free (for public repositories)
- **Anthropic Claude API**: Pay-per-use (~$0.25 per 1M tokens)
- **Self-hosted backend**: Your server costs (VPS starting at $5/month)

For most personal use, the AI costs are minimal (pennies per document).
